      <description>When the idea came up to make the package scraparazzie, the main purpose is to grab news by topics and keywords. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t really need the news content but title, source and publish date, so that I can receive news with further setting and send the results to an IM bot. That&amp;rsquo;s why I made scraprazzie. And, yes, mainly for stock market and agriculture news (eh&amp;hellip;target in commoditiesðŸ¤«) Somehow I found a tutorial about application in LINE Notify, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it!</description>
