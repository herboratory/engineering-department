      <description>Project Information: scraparazzie is a Python package for searching specific topic or keywords of Google News feeds. It had been spending for around 4 days to deal with scraparazzie, a python package for searching Google News feeds. This package is based on gnewsclient as framework to modify and enhance features.
Features that gnewsclient have:  Available to set language, location, topic and number of output items for searching; Available to show image and video (if there is) link of the news  Features that scraparazzie have:  Available to show publish datetime; Except topic, keywords searching is included (either topic or keyword searching, and keyword searching is the top priority searching); Take away the feature to show image and video (if there is) link of the news; Result shows from latest to oldest; Export as list  The main reason I decided to deal with this project is personal use - I need a something that can help me to collect latest news with title, source, link and publish date at fixed time for further application.</description>
