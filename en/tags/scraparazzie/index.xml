      <description>When the idea came up to make the package scraparazzie, the main purpose is to grab news by topics and keywords. Since I don&amp;rsquo;t really need the news content but title, source and publish date, so that I can receive news with further setting and send the results to an IM bot. That&amp;rsquo;s why I made scraprazzie. And, yes, mainly for stock market and agriculture news (eh&amp;hellip;target in commoditiesðŸ¤«) Somehow I found a tutorial about application in LINE Notify, so let&amp;rsquo;s do it!</description>

      <description>Project Information: scraparazzie is a Python package for searching specific topic or keywords of Google News feeds. It had been spending for around 4 days to deal with scraparazzie, a python package for searching Google News feeds. This package is based on gnewsclient as framework to modify and enhance features.
Features that gnewsclient have:  Available to set language, location, topic and number of output items for searching; Available to show image and video (if there is) link of the news  Features that scraparazzie have:  Available to show publish datetime; Except topic, keywords searching is included (either topic or keyword searching, and keyword searching is the top priority searching); Take away the feature to show image and video (if there is) link of the news; Result shows from latest to oldest; Export as list  The main reason I decided to deal with this project is personal use - I need a something that can help me to collect latest news with title, source, link and publish date at fixed time for further application.</description>
